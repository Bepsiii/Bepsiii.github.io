                <h2>£25 Budget Killer? My First Impressions.</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="review-date-meta" style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:1.5rem; color: #888; font-size:0.9em;">Published: October 23, 2023</p>
            
            <div id="review-main-content"> <p class="review-intro">
                    When Moondrop announced their first sub-$30 TWS, the Space Travel, I was definitely curious. Could these be a hard hitter in the budget category? Let's find out.
                </p>

                <div class="project-image-placeholder" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    <img src="images/reviews/spacetravel/moondrop_spacetravel_main.jpg" alt="Moondrop Space Travel TWS" onerror="this.alt='Moondrop Space Travel Placeholder'; this.src='https://via.placeholder.com/800x450/333333/eeeeee?text=Moondrop+Space+Travel'; this.style.maxWidth='100%'; this.style.height='auto';" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; border-radius: 8px;">
                </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-box-open"></i> Unboxing</h3>
                    <p>
                        The unboxing experience of the Space Travels is what I've come to expect from a budget release – a basic box with a small amount of accessories. The design of the box is nice; however, due to the materials used, the plastic shell looks foggy and does kinda take away from the experience, although that's just a small nitpick. Unfortunately, due to the case being somewhat loose, the buds shook loose and turned on in the case, which can quite substantially drain battery over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the box you get the basics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Short Type C cable (A male to C Male)</li>
                        <li>Selection of tips (S, M, L - oval shape)</li>
                        <li>Documentation</li>
                        <li>The case and buds</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I found the standard tips rather uncomfortable and they easily slipped out of my ear. They're an oval shape as opposed to the normal circle tips, though this doesn't stop you from using aftermarket tips.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> Fit, Finish & Build Quality</h3>
                    <p>
                        The fit on these is inoffensive, and with foam tips, I found it to be pleasant. The lightness played a nice part in it, and they can be worn over long periods as long as the battery allows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The case quality is nicely polished apart from the glaring issues of the buds sometimes falling out. However, on my unit, I did find the clear part to be particularly greasy and slick even after using a cloth to clean it. I wish I could say the same for the buds; the quality on my unit was quite absurd and a surprise on how they passed QC with sharp seams on the buds. When adjusting these for comfort, it partially cut my ear. I have no idea if this was a one-off; however, it has made me a bit cautious about recommending these to others. For obvious reasons, I won't be posting a picture of the sharp seam with blood, however, you can see below the seam quality and the glue quality isn't amazing. A chat to Amazon and they didn't seem bothered about it and wanted to resell the product after I returned them, which the associate told me quite bluntly. However, I have added some additional glue to the seam and sanded it down with fine sandpaper so all is fine now.

                <div id="sound-quality-section" class="about-subsection"> <h3><i class="fas fa-music"></i> Sound Quality</h3>
                    <p>
                        To put it simply, for how much these cost, the sound is impeccable as long as you aren't a basshead like me. I have been using these with a Pixel 6 (using AAC) and my personal Plexamp server using FLACs & also Spotify. The sound profile didn't "wow" me at first; however, when I started using these more, they started to sound well-tuned and although they don't get loud, they are quite spacious. The bass response isn't incredible even with the "Basshead" EQ profile on Moondrop's Link app, which I found actually dulled everything, including bass.
                    </p>
                    </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i> Moondrop Link 2.0 App</h3>
                    <p>
                        Moondrop's new and improved app... it's lackluster, simply. Some parts of the app are still in Chinese, and in the UK at least, the app can only be downloaded via an APK on Moondrop's website, which is not secure to say the least, especially with the amount of permissions it asks for. The features inside the app are extremely lacking with no way to change ANC or transparency modes.
                    </p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Other Tidbits & Annoyances</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One of the main annoyances I have is the lack of being able to pair with multiple devices or an easy way to disconnect from one device and switch to another. These use Bluetooth 5.3 which, as far as I'm aware, supports switching and multiple devices.</li>
                        <li>Moondrop took inspiration from Apple, and the charging port is on the bottom of the case.</li>
                        <li>Touch controls have a solid second between pressing and it registering.</li>
                        <li>Battery life is pretty fubar, and charging speeds are quite fubar too, with them taking about 90 mins from empty to full (the buds in the case). I found myself recharging these multiple times within a day for use on my PC.</li>
                        <li>ANC and Transparency modes are present; however, ANC doesn't do a whole lot, and transparency has a lot of white noise.</li>
                        <li>No IPX rating, which even at this price point can be found (see Anker's lineup).</li>
                        <li>No wireless charging; a small annoyance, however, other options have this present, and it would've been a nice addition given where the charge port is.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    Good for the price, but don't expect amazing things outside of the sound quality, as they do come across as half-baked, especially in some areas. They're decent for desktop use and phone use, with good tuning especially for budget; however, build quality definitely screams budget.
