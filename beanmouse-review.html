                Disclaimer: These units were printed on my own printer and the print quality does not reflect the product you will get if you buy from CC. (D’s printer of which being 10x better than my own!). Whilst I use PLA on my units, D prints in PETG-CF which is a better filament for structural components and therefore mice.

                    <p>
                        The BeanMouse V2.½.2 is a completely custom designed fingertip grip style shell made to work with the Razer Viper V2 Pro internals. Coming in at 40 AUD, it's by far one of the most cost-effective shells you can get for the VV2P. It's a shell made to be comfortable for a wider range of people, whether you have larger or smaller hands, or even if you are left-handed.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Performance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Performance, not much to say. It's a Razer Viper V2 Pro. It has a great implementation of a 3950 sensor with Razer's own custom branded Raesha optical switches. The sensor position on the BeanMouse puts it in line with your thumb, making for a responsive experience. Although a further forward sensor would make this better, that's simply not possible since it's a PCB made for a different mouse.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-subsection">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-paper"></i> Shape & Design Breakdown</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most standout feature of the BeanMouse is its shape; nothing like it has been seen before, even on other custom shells. This is, however, its best quality. Its uniqueness shines and shows itself as an advantage over other shapes since it doesn't force you into an awkward grip, as this is made to be universal. I'll be splitting this part into a few categories.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Thumb Groove / Rest</h4>
                    <p>
                        The thumb groove, to put it simply, is one of the shape's best features. With the comfort groove at the top of the thumb groove, it makes for an excellent experience and allows for a much more natural grip style, much more relaxed compared to other shells. The small variant of the BeanMouse I have been testing could benefit largely from a slightly larger thumb groove, especially towards the front of the groove. Using the small with larger hands like mine means that my thumb does go over the rest and sometimes drags on the pad; a simple extension of the bottom part would go a long way, with this being a non-issue on the large. The comfort groove at the top provides excellent support and fits great in my chunky ass thumb.
                    </p>

                     <div class="project-image-placeholder" style="margin-top:1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                        <img src="images/setup/reviews/beanmouse/beanmouse_thumb_groove.jpg" alt="BeanMouse Thumb Groove Detail" onerror="this.alt='Thumb Groove Placeholder'; this.src='https://via.placeholder.com/700x400/333333/eeeeee?text=Thumb+Groove+Detail'; this.style.maxWidth='100%'; this.style.height='auto';" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto; border-radius: 8px;">
                    </div>

                    <h4>Click Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        At first, the click design was more of an issue to me than it is now. However, after using it for a week or so, it's easily one of the better/best out there, especially on this shape of mouse. The main comparison being Optimum Tech's ZeroMouse. The click design on the BeanMouse has 0 pre or post-travel which, in my opinion, makes for one of the nicest optical implementations on accident. Some additional support material or guides could be used to connect the clicks more securely to the shell; however, superglue worked extremely well in my case, especially for minor adjustments on where the plunger is positioned. The only minor gripe I have with it is the clearance with the scroll wheel encoder.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Right Wall / Finger Support</h4>
                    <p>
                        The right wall/support is great since it doesn't have designated grip points but instead opts for a universal solution. This part is angled outwards to the mouse and lets you get a firmer grip on the shell. The comfort grooves give a great resting place for the ring and pinky; however, with my grip style, I had an issue with the rear end being too flared out / too long and it digging into my lower pinky. The right wall on the small could be improved a slight bit by closing the hole in the middle of it; however, that's a minor gripe and is most likely a non-issue on anything that isn't PLA.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>General Design & Build</h4>
                     <p>Honestly, not much to say here apart from its structurally sound and I had zero build issues on both the small and the revised large (when printed correctly).</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i> Short Review / Initial Thoughts</h3>
                     <p>
                        The BeanMouse is one of the first fingertip mice I have had the pleasure of trying. The shape is great and allows for a greater range of grip types and support, especially when looking at other 3D printed shells from others. The clicks are some of the lightest and most spammable implementations I've used, especially with Raesha opticals.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div> <div class="about-subsection">
                <h3><i class="fas fa-award"></i> Final Thoughts & Value</h3>
                <p>
                    For 40 USD, this is incredible value, especially with the competition on the market. I'm excited to see where D takes this shape and any new mice he may cook up. This is a great shape for anyone looking to try a dedicated fingertip mouse, and with how cheap Viper V2 Pros can be on eBay, you can easily have yourself the best fingertip mouse under 70 USD.
                </p>
                <p><strong>My Recommendation:</strong> Highly Recommended for Fingertip Grip Users!</p>
